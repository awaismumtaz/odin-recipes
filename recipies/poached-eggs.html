        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>2 slices bacon</li>       
            <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</li> 
            <li>½ medium potato, peeled and chopped</li> 
            <li>¼ medium onion, chopped</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt, divided</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li> 
            <li>⅛ cup chopped kale</li> 
            <li>¼ teaspoon truffle oil, or to taste</li> 
            <li>2 large eggs</li> 2 large eggs
        </ol>
             <h2>Directions</h2>
             
        <ul>
           <li>Place bacon in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
           <li>Add ghee to the bacon drippings. Add potato, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook and stir until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes, adding kale during the last few minutes. Remove potatoes to a plate and crumble bacon slices over top. Reduce pan temperature to low.</li>
           <li>
            When pan has cooled to low, crack eggs into the pan. Season with remaining salt and pepper. Cook until eggs are almost completely set but not hard, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Carefully flip eggs and cook until whites are completely set, about 30 second more. Gently slide eggs on top of the potato hash. Drizzle with truffle oil and serve.
